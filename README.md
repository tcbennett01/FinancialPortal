# Household Budget Application  

The budgeting app was our 3rd MVC project using the same technologies:  ASP.NET MVC, C#, and front-end technologies. In this project, we introduced partial views, AJAX for real-time updates, and integrated Morris Charts for visualizations.  Same disclaimer as before.  The code is not intended to represent clean code standards or basic SOLID principles.  Requirement was to get it done by deadline while meeting all acceptance criteria.
